# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This R script works with data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. 

First, it merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. After, it extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
